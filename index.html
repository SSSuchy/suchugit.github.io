	<!-- Background -->
	<h3>BACKGROUND/EARLY LIFE!</h3>
	<p>Srinivasa Ramanujan was a brilliant Indian mathematician who was ahead of his time in the 19th century. His discoveries would be known around the world 20 years after he died which was in <strong>April 26, 1920</strong> to the disease of Amoebiasis. Born in <strong>Erode India, December 22, 1887</strong>, he was considered a miracle child. He was ahead of his time by creating formulas that would be later used by other mathematicians. G.H. Hardy believed that Ramanujan could improve the world and believed he would make a big difference. Hardy took Ramanujan into a private university and told Ramanujan about the world and how his formulas could be used in other areas of Science.</p>
